## **Product Brief**

- Firefly Catcher (FFC) is envisioned to be the **world’s largest and free AI-Agent marketplace**. Agents are freely downloadable.
- FFC Agents are **production grade apps** ready to be deployed to the **FFC cloud with a single click**.
- FFC is targeted to anyone wanting to build or enhance their business using AI-Agents.
- Users can choose to deploy Agents to their own infrastructure thus having complete control over security, privacy, enterprise requirements etc.
- The FFC marketplace welcomes software developers and technology companies to develop AI-Agents using the FFC Agentic Framework (an open source framework) and submit to the marketplace. Such marketplace agents can have either of two available commercial models, Free or Paid with a monthly subscription. FFC will retain 20% of the revenue and pass on 80% to the developer.
- Pre-built foundational Agent components are part of the Open source framework and are freely available.
- The open source framework will be managed by FFC but will welcome contributions from the Open Source Community.
- If customers choose to deploy agents to FFC Cloud they will be charged by the GB-Hour (RAM used by Agent instance in GB and the time in hours for which the agent is running). Agents can be run in “Test” mode and “Live” mode. Some platform credits will be provided for “Test” mode instances.



## **Core Technology and Differentiators**

At the heart of the business is a  powerful domain specific language specifically developed for creating AI-Agents. This DSL (domain specific language) is called “Automaton”. The design, direction and future of Automaton language specification will be managed by the community and the industry with FFC being the custodian at the time being and in the future managed by a governing body.

State of the art Generative models will be custom trained to fully learn the Automaton language. This custom model will be responsible for generating the “specification files” of any agents automatically based on user requirements. These specifications are thus the “program” written in the “Automaton” language.

When AI-Agents are deployed to the FFC Cloud or a self hosted FFC runtime, the runtime processes the Agent specifications files and deploys the agent.

The Agents are fully contained deployment units which can be enhanced by user specified proprietary code. Users can freely implement any user defined component that the FFC runtime will understand and configure.

The secret sauce is the ambitious goal to train the state of the art custom generative model to a point where it can continuously scan the web and create Agentic solution ideas for business problems across industry segments and then automatically create “specifications” in the “Automaton” language. This is the single most important differentiator. The ultimate objective is to perfect the “Automaton” language with rich constructs specifically meaningful for an AI \- first economy and the “Meta-Agent” which continuously spews out new Agent specs non-stop. The most important and best Agents will be reviewed, adjusted, enhanced, tested and put into the marketplace for free. We expect to see hundreds or thousands of new AI-Agents in the marketplace every month across all significant industry sectors.
