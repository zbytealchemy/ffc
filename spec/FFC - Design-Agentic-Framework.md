### **SDK Functions and Their Exposed API Purposes**

**Agent Creation and Management**

* **Purpose**: To allow developers to create and configure agents with detailed specifications, constraints, and behavior definitions.
* **Exposed API Functions**:
  * `createAgent()` / `AgentBuilder()`: Instantiates a new agent object with provided configuration.
  * `defineTask()`: Attaches task handlers to an agent, defining its capabilities and actions.

**Task Management**

* **Purpose**: To facilitate the addition, modification, and execution of tasks that an agent can perform.
* **Exposed API Functions**:
  * `defineTask()`: Specifies a new task and its execution logic.
  * `addRetryPolicy()`: Sets retry logic for task execution failures.

**Permission and Security**

* **Purpose**: To enforce boundaries on agent actions, ensuring security and compliance.
* **Exposed API Functions**:
  * `setPermissions()`: Defines what an agent is permitted or prohibited from doing.
  * `validatePermissions()`: Validates if the agent's intended operations align with defined permissions.

**Telemetry and Observability**

* **Purpose**: To capture performance metrics, logs, and other observability data during agent operation.
* **Exposed API Functions**:
  * `emitTelemetry()`: Sends telemetry data for tracking and monitoring.
  * `logEvent()`: Logs significant events during agent execution.

**Sandbox and Testing Execution**

* **Purpose**: To provide a safe environment for testing agents without affecting production environments.
* **Exposed API Functions**:
  * `runInSandbox()`: Runs the agent in a controlled environment to test behavior.
  * `validateOutput()`: Compares actual agent output with expected results.

### **Technology Options for SDKs and Their Justification**

**1\. TypeScript/Node.js**

* **Technology**: Node.js with TypeScript
* **Reason**: TypeScript provides type safety and enhanced development experience, which is essential for maintaining complex codebases. Node.js supports asynchronous programming, making it suitable for I/O-heavy operations typical in agent execution.
* **Winner**: **TypeScript/Node.js**, due to its modern language features, vast package ecosystem, and asynchronous capabilities.

**2\. Python**

* **Technology**: Python with FastAPI or Flask for API endpoints
* **Reason**: Python’s simplicity and rich ecosystem make it ideal for developing SDKs used by data scientists and backend developers. FastAPI offers excellent performance and asynchronous support with minimal overhead.
* **Winner**: **Python with FastAPI**, due to its modern syntax, speed, and integration capabilities.

**3\. Java/JVM**

* **Technology**: Java with Spring Boot
* **Reason**: Java's strong type system and performance, coupled with Spring Boot’s enterprise features, make it a great fit for building robust SDKs. It integrates seamlessly with existing enterprise environments and supports REST and microservice architectures.
* **Winner**: **Java with Spring Boot**, due to enterprise readiness, scalability, and ease of integration with other Java-based systems.

**Conclusion for Technology Implementation**: Each SDK leverages the strengths of its language and ecosystem:

* **TypeScript/Node.js SDK** is best for developers who prefer modern, event-driven, asynchronous programming.
* **Python SDK** suits data-centric and ML-heavy agent development due to its easy syntax and broad library support.
